## Registrar - A Registry Handling Configuration thing
I made this because I was tired of writing things like [this](https://pastebin.com/m8vY9vwb)
This has not been extensively tested yet, outside of the RegistrarTest application. I plan
on migrating all my C# applications which use settings classes like the one linked
over to using this one, and I am currently working on something that is going to use this.

So don't be surprised if it explodes. I THINK everything should be working properly though.

## Examples
Go look in RegistrarTest, it's pretty easy to use this.
